          Classification: Internal / Behavioral Anomaly<br>
          Status: Escalated
        </p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Multiple subjects previously exposed to PRK compounds displayed delayed neurological response
        patterns following periods of non-exposure. Symptoms manifested without recent contact.
      </p>

      <h3>Observed Effects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Time-lagged motor impairment</li>
        <li>Auditory processing delay</li>
        <li>Involuntary micro-movements during rest states</li>
        <li>Reported sensation of “anticipation without stimulus”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Initial assumption of withdrawal-related response was discarded after similar symptoms appeared
        in subjects with no reported craving or dependency markers.
      </p>

      <h3>Concern</h3>
      <p>
        This suggests the compound may establish latent interaction pathways independent of continued exposure.
        Further deployment without long-cycle studies is not advised.
