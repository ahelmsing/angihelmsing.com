      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Following the FP-77 release window (Ref: PRK-009), Product Strategy initiated a limited review
        of consumer behavior associated with micro-variance exposure within the Pebble Pops fruit line.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Observations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Repeat purchase rate increased by 218% in pilot regions</li>
        <li>Average unit per transaction rose from 1.6 to 3.9</li>
        <li>Consumer dwell time at shelf locations increased by 41%</li>
        <li>Brand substitution behavior observed across adjacent snack categories</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Preference Anchoring</h3>
      <p>
        Data indicates formation of rapid brand anchoring following minimal exposure. Once established,
        preference persists even when product is temporarily unavailable, redirecting purchase behavior
        rather than deferring it.
      </p>

      <h3>Scalability Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        Modeling suggests that controlled deployment at sub-threshold concentrations could influence
        market share across multiple Harmony brands without triggering conventional regulatory review
        thresholds.
      </p>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Continue variance-controlled testing under “flavor enhancement” classification</li>
        <li>Expand monitoring to GoldenVale and select Nova Harvest derivative lines</li>
        <li>Limit documentation visibility to Strategy, Product Integrity, and Executive</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Risk Notes</h3>
      <p>
        While current deployment remains within compliance margins, sustained preference shaping
        may invite long-term scrutiny if pattern recognition occurs outside controlled datasets.
