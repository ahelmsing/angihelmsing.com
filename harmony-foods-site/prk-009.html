      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        During routine flavor prep for Pebble Pops fruit line, a micro vial of PRK compound concentrate
        was introduced into Batch FP-77 by accidental contact during transfer. Incident occurred at
        Line 3, Station B, during shift change.
      </p>

      <h3>Immediate Actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Batch FP-77 was flagged for hold, then released after sensory panel reported no off-notes</li>
        <li>Sanitation protocol re-run on Line 3</li>
        <li>Vial inventory audited, count reconciled after 46 minutes</li>
        <li>Employee coaching completed, no further escalation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Observed Market Effects</h3>
      <p>
        Within 72 hours of distribution, FP-77 sell-through exceeded seasonal projections. Retail partners
        reported repeated restock requests and unusually high single-flavor preference.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Velocity exceeded baseline by 4.1x in pilot region</li>
        <li>Customer feedback indicated "strong preference" without clear flavor descriptors</li>
        <li>Adjacent flavors showed measurable preference drop during the same period</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Internal Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Product Integrity confirms the compound concentration in FP-77 was below lowest lab threshold
        for structured response testing. Despite this, market behavior suggests an interaction with
        existing flavor architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recommendation: Document as a variance event. Do not attribute market response to formulation
        variance in external communications.
      </p>

      <h3>Origin Classification</h3>
      <p>
        Compound input lot traced to Nova Harvest Group import channel. Source documentation indicates
        legal intergalactic trade compliance. Origin region listed as Corridor 9. Secondary identifier
        references Galaxy 9 distribution hub.
