      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This memo establishes external response guidance related to recent demand volatility in the
        Pebble Pops fruit line within pilot markets. Consistent language is required across retail
        partners, customer support, and media-facing touchpoints.
      </p>

      <h3>Approved External Language</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Seasonal demand and regional promotion uplift.”</li>
        <li>“Limited run distribution concentration.”</li>
        <li>“Improved shelf placement and retail engagement.”</li>
        <li>“Positive taste response to refreshed fruit assortment.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Not Approved</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Any mention of “formula variance,” “batch variance,” or “processing deviation.”</li>
        <li>Any reference to internal classifications, incident numbering, or compound terminology.</li>
        <li>Any language implying dependency, craving behavior, or “can’t stop eating.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Internal Handling</h3>
      <p>
        Customer feedback demonstrating repeated single-flavor preference should be categorized under
        “High Satisfaction Response.” Do not escalate to Product Safety unless accompanied by a confirmed
        adverse event report.
      </p>

      <h3>Action Items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>PulseWave to provide a one-page partner script for retail managers.</li>
        <li>Pebble Pops team to maintain current public-facing ingredient statements with no additions.</li>
        <li>Sales leads to report weekly velocity and stock-out data to Product Integrity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="i-stamp">INTERNAL ONLY. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE.</p>
