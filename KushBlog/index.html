              I wasn’t going to say anything at first, because nobody ever believes me
              when I say stuff like this, but I’m pretty sure that planet was following us.
            </p>

            <p>
              I noticed it right after Nuggs “optimized” our route and somehow made the trip
              longer. Same planet. Same weird colors. Same unsettling vibe.
            </p>

            <p>
              I mentioned it to Dank, who said it was impossible, then immediately asked if
              planets can hold grudges. Nuggs said it was a visual glitch and shut off half
              the ship.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually the planet disappeared. Which is exactly what a guilty planet would do.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ll write more… later.

              According to the snack inventory, we were doing great. Plenty of chips.
              Multiple emergency chocolate bars. Something labeled “backup snacks”
              that I don’t remember buying but trusted completely.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to reality, we had crumbs, one suspicious raisin, and a drawer
              that smelled like hope and disappointment.
            </p>

            <p>
              I stared at the shelf for a solid minute waiting for the snacks to load in.
              They did not. Nuggs suggested maybe the snacks were “between states.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Dank said this is why we shouldn’t trust spreadsheets made at 2am.
            </p>

            <p>
              I updated the inventory to say “snacks pending.”

      <h2 class="post-title">Dank Says This Is “Not a Real Emergency”</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">By Kush • January 9, 2026</p>
      <div class="post-body">
        <p>
          I want to be clear up front: Dank says this was “not a real emergency.” He said it calmly, which is how you
          know he was wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          The issue was that the ship started making a new noise. Not a loud noise. Not an alarm noise. Just a
          <em>different</em> noise. A soft hum, but… judgmental. Like it knew something.
        </p>

        <p>
          I paused what I was doing to listen. The noise paused too. That’s when it became an emergency.
        </p>

        <p>
          I called Dank to the cockpit and explained that the ship was “thinking too loud.” He listened for maybe two
          seconds and said, “That’s the cooling system,” which didn’t help because it was never that loud before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nuggs suggested we turn the music up until the ship stopped feeling weird about itself. Dank said that was not
          a solution. I said neither was ignoring a machine that had clearly developed opinions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually the noise went away. Dank declared the emergency over. I stayed alert for another hour, just in
          case the ship was regrouping.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the record, if something stops acting strange the moment you start paying attention to it, that doesn’t
          mean it wasn’t real. It just means it knows you’re watching.

      <h2 class="post-title">Why Nuggs Is Banned From the Control Panel</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">By Kush • January 12, 2026</p>

        <div class="post-body">

            Nuggs is banned from the control panel. This wasn’t a fast decision. This was a “we should’ve done this
            earlier” decision.
          </p>

          <p>
            It started when Nuggs said, “What does this button do?” which is a sentence that should never be spoken out
            loud in space. Before anyone could answer, he pressed it. Not aggressively. Casually. Like it was curious.
          </p>

          <p>
            The lights dimmed. The ship rotated slightly. A calm voice announced we were “optimizing trajectory,” which
            is never something you want to hear unexpectedly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nuggs said it was fine because the ship sounded confident. Dank reminded him that confidence and correctness
            are not the same thing. Nuggs said that felt personal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then the screen changed colors. Not warning colors. Fun colors. That’s when I knew we were in trouble.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everything went back to normal after a few minutes, except none of us trusted the ship anymore. Nuggs said
            he was just “helping it stretch.” Dank took his access card.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nuggs is still allowed near the snacks. For now.

      <h2 class="post-title">I’ll Write This Down… Later</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">By Kush • January 18, 2026</p>
      <div class="post-body">
        <p>
          I keep meaning to write things down. Important things. Things I specifically tell myself I should not forget.
          This has been a consistent system failure.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll have a thought that feels absolutely crucial. Like it could change how we do everything. I’ll say,
          “That’s important,” out loud, so the universe knows I noticed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I’ll immediately get distracted by something unrelated. A sound. A light. The idea of snacks. The thought
          will drift away calmly, like it was never worried about being remembered.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes I remember that I forgot something, which feels productive at first. But I can never remember
          <em>what</em> it was. Just that it mattered. Deeply. Probably.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried writing things down right away, but then I’d get halfway through a sentence and realize I needed a
          better pen. Or a different notebook. Or a snack to support the writing process.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the time I come back, the thought is gone and I’m left with a notebook that says, “IMPORTANT:” and nothing
          else.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve decided this is fine. If a thought is truly meant to stay, it’ll come back. And if it doesn’t, it
          probably wasn’t ready yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll write this down… later.
